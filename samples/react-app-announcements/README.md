## Features

This project contains sample SharePoint Framework application customizer built using React and Office UI Fabric React. The application customizer retrieves urgent organizational announcements and displays them to the user until she acknowledges that she has seen them. Which announcements have been seen is stored in the local browser storage.

This sample illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* using Office UI Fabric React to build SharePoint Framework application customizers that seamlessly integrate with SharePoint
* using React to build SharePoint Framework application customizers
* logging information to console using a custom SharePoint Framework log handler
* retrieving information from SharePoint using the SPHttpClient
* rendering information in page placeholders
* storing information in the local browser storage
* passing configuration parameters into application customizers
