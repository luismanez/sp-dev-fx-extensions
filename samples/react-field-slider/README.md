## Features
This project contains SharePoint Framework extensions that illustrates next features:
* field customizer
* usage of Office UI Fabric React
* usage of PnP JS
* inline editing of list items (Users who have EditListItems permissions can edit value by dragging the slider)

**NOTE:** this customizer should be applied to a column with type Number. For the simplicity author assumes that the values of the column are between 0 and 100.
To use with Percentage column the code should be modified to multiply `value` by 100

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

* lib/* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
* dist/* - the bundled script, along with other resources
* deploy/* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

## Debug URL for testing
Here's a debug URL for testing around this sample. Notice that this sample is designed to be used with **Number** field type. In below debug URL sample we define the field internal name as **Percent**. Slider in this case is designed to show values between 0 and 100.
