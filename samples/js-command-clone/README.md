## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repository
- Update the `pageUrl` properties in the **config/serve.json** file
  - The `pageUrl` should be a list view in your tenant
  - This property is only used during development in conjunction with the `gulp serve` command
- In the command line navigate to **samples/js-command-clone** and run:
  - `npm install`
  - `gulp serve`
- In the web browser:
  - Choose **Load Debug Scripts** when prompted
  - Select 1 or more items and choose **clone** from either the command bar or the context menu
  - Behold the marvels of science

## Features
SPFx Clone utilizes PnP JS Core to quickly copy multiple list items.

This extension illustrates the following concepts:

- Loading **PnP JS Core** from a CDN
- Conditionally showing commands based on the **number of selected rows**
- Conditionally showing commands based on the **user's permission level**
- Requesting **List Field** information
- **Batching Get requests** for list items
- **Field selection** and **Expanded fields** using PnP JS Core
- Adding multiple items in a single **Batch**
- Field specific formats for REST operations including
  - Person
  - Multi Persons
  - Lookups
  - Multi Lookups
  - Multi Choice
  - Projected Fields
  - Taxonomy Fields
  - Multi Taxonomy Fields
  - And all other standard fields


## Debug URL for testing
Here's a debug querystring for testing this sample:

```
?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&customActions={"bf6645bd-42e4-4a30-aad7-6ff12d61fa1f":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ListViewCommandSet"}}
```

Your URL will look similar to the following (replace with your domain and site address):
```
https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite/Lists/yourlist/AllItems.aspx?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&customActions={"bf6645bd-42e4-4a30-aad7-6ff12d61fa1f":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ListViewCommandSet"}}
```
